# Exercise - MCP Servers
#
#  In this exercise you will provide multiple tools to the LLM via an MCP server.
#  The tools are the same as the last exercise, except you will use an MCP server.
#
#  Currently the MCP server implements only one tool - `tool_get_customer_office_locations`.
#  The two other functions are imported above, but not exposed as tools.
#
#  * Define `tool_get_customer_annual_spend(idx: int) -> int` to return the annual spend for a given customer index.
#  * Define `tool_get_customer_list() -> list[dict]` to return the list of customers.`
#  * NOTE: Make sure both tools have a description (this is a Bedrock requirement).
#
#  * Once done, open Claude Code and make sure the MCP server starts correctly.
#  * Then, ask Claude questions about customers, e.g.:
#      - How many high-value customers (spending more than 1 million a year) are there?
#      - Which customers have offices in Europe?
#      - Which customers have offices in the US and spend more than 2 million a year?
#      - Which countries do high-value customers (spending more than 1 million a year) have offices in?
